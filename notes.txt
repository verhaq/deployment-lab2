AWS Instance commands/order

sudo su = sudo super user (don't have to write sudo in front of everything everytime)

apt update = apt is a package handler

apt upgrade, press y, then press enter at the pink screen if it appears

apt install nodejs - y then press enter at the pink screen if it appears

apt install npm -y

npm i -g n

n stable (downloads most stable version of node)

npm i -g npm (npm using npm), may need to reconnect to the instance (do the sudo su command before doing 'npm i -g npm' again)

npm i -g nodemon

Then, we will create a key and put key on github

npm i -g pm2

ssh-keygen -t rsa

ls -a

cd .ssh

ls

cat id_rsa.pub

copy the key

go to github, go to settings, press ssh and gpg keys, press new ssh key, name your key, paste the key in 'Key' space, and press Add SSH key

Your key should now be added

go to repository, click on green code button, click on ssh, copy the ssh, go back to the instance (if this does not work, click on the repository settings, click on deploy keys, and add your key before going back to the instance) 

cd ~

git clone [the ssh we just copied from github]

Enter 'yes' when asked 'are you sure you want to continue connecting'

ls

npm i

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 4000
